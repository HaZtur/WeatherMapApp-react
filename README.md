WeatherMapApp is a very simple React application utilizing 
the Mapbox GL and OpenWeatherMap APIs. It contains a map 
which shows current temperature levels globally and a seperate
window for viewing local weather info. 

Local weather info can be accessed by double clicking anywhere 
on the map or by performing an address search. It contains
a summary of current weather (temperature, humidity and wind speed)
and a five day forecast shown as a graph."# WeatherMapApp-react"
